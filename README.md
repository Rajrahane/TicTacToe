# TicTacToe
Q)What is it?

A Tic Tac Toe Game based on Minimax Algorithm.Develop an AI that beats the player in every game.Try your best to defeat it.

Q)How Does it work?

Creates a Game Tree and applies Depth First Search (DFS) to find the best possible move.

Randomises moves using the Random library funtion.

Improved minimax algorithm to maximise win chances.

That is, if the worst case scenario is a draw, a best case move(win), if available, is played.
