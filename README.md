# TicTacToe
Implements a Tic Tac Toe Game based on Minimax Algorithm.

Creates a Game Tree and applies Depth First Search (DFS) to find the best possible move.

Randomises moves using the Random library funtion.

Improved minimax algorithm to maximise win chances.

If the worst case scenario is a draw, a best case move, if available, is played.  

Please have a look at https://github.com/Rajrahane/TicTacToe/blob/master/TicTacToe.docx for the detailed explanation of the improvements.
